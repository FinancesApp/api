# :zap: API **|** Finances App

## :thinking: Introduction

The project is based on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as language, [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) as ORM, [Express](https://expressjs.com/pt-br/) as Framework and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as Database.

- `GET /users/@me` - Fetch authenticated user information.
- `GET /categories` - Fetch the Authenticated User Category List.
- `GET /items` - Fetch the Authenticated User Item List
- `POST /users` - Create a new user.
- `POST /categories` - Create a new category.
- `POST /items` - Create a new item.
- `DELETE /categories/:category_id` - Remove a category by ID.
- `DELETE /items/:item_id` - Remove an item by ID.

## :file_cabinet: Database tables

All database management is being handled by Prisma, to record all migrations, run the command `npm prisma migrate dev` or `yarn prisma migrate dev`.

Then all migrations will be registered in the database, and you can start the application using the command `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.

To run the application build process, run the command `npm run build` or `yarn dev`. And finally, run the command `npm run start` or `yarn start` to start the server with the files generated by the build process.
